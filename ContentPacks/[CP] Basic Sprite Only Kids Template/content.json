    How to add more kids besides the four already written:

    1. Put baby sprite you want to use in assets/baby folder
    2. Put toddler sprite you want to use in assets/toddler folder
    3. Name the sprite PNGs after your kid's name and make sure you have one baby and one toddler, i.e. for 'bob' you need assets/baby/bob.png and assets/toddler/bob.png
    4. Add another one of these { "Action": "Include", ... } blocks below this comment block, and edit the LocalTokens section, don't forget the comma
